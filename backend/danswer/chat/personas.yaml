# Currently in the UI, each Persona only has one prompt, which is why there are 3 very similar personas defined below.

personas:
  # This id field can be left blank for other default personas, however an id 0 persona must exist
  # this is for DanswerBot to use when tagged in a non-configured channel
  # Careful setting specific IDs, this won't autoincrement the next ID value for postgres
  - id: 0

    # Default Document Sets for this persona, specified as a list of names here.
    # If the document set by the name exists, it will be attached to the persona
    # If the document set by the name does not exist, it will be created as an empty document set with no connectors
    # The admin can then use the UI to add new connectors to the document set
    # Example:
    # document_sets:
    #   - "HR Resources"
    #   - "Engineer Onboarding"
    #   - "Benefits"
